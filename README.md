A Simple repo storing my learning journey in ML core libraries, and a few hands on exercises and projects. Below i would share good links to study ML yourself without any teacher.

You need to learn python first in order to continue to below modules. You can start from exercism.com to learn and pratice or hackerrank to practice only if you know python. Try to stick to one platform and keep learning there.

<< You might make mistakes often but do not worry, we all start somehwhere. Making mistakes is just telling you that you are going in the right direction. >>

Intro to ML: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/intro-to-ml
If you are new to ML and do not know anything, go through this above course, wherever stuck tell your goal and ask gpt to explain you in the simplest way possible.
There are multiple exercises in between to valuate what you understood, you can ask GPT to give you small assessments to evaluate yourself too.

This takes you ML journey to next level, you can go through this course to learn the ML in the most crisp manner. It will teach you basics and intermediate things both. Remember to make notes!!

Pandas playlist: https://youtu.be/ml-saZ3HK9I?si=QdZmrt306_OlrZgr
This is a good playlist to learn necessary things from pandas. You might be able to find better too but i found this one to be good enough for my learning speed. Practice all in a notebook and store it.
Keep giving small tests

Numpy playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN2CZKgAsIxz2HN7y1NLnS2zFfGqlWMdl&si=-YLxZqL7-Ob4bsml
I started from numpy first then went to pandas, you can go any way you want. Practice all in a notebook and store it.
Keep giving small tests. There can be some concepts which are missing but mostly are covered, using evaluative assessments you can see what you need to learn and practice more.
